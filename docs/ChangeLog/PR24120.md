## Changes requiring user action

### Key Override Introspection

Changes were made to key overrides in order to hook them into the keymap introspection system.

Key override signature changed from:

```c
const key_override_t **key_overrides = (const key_override_t *[]){
```

to:

```c
const key_override_t *key_overrides[] = {
```

The list of key overrides now does not need to be `NULL`-terminated.
